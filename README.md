___________________________________________

[ Configuring Database ]
Add this to tf/addons/sourcemod/configs/database.cfg

	"tfrp"
	{
		"driver"			"default"
		"host"				""
		"database"			""
		"user"				""
		"pass"				""
	}

Enter your database information accordingly

[ Configuring ]

*All config files can be found at addons/sourcemod/configs/tfrp/cfg
*General configuration can be found in tfrp_config.txt

[Configuring Shop]

*Shop can be found in tfrp_shop.txt
*All items MUST have a valid category or else it won't show up!
*You can make categories in tfrp_categories
*The number the category has is how high it will apear in the shop
(Ex: 1 will be first in the shop)

*Shop items have 3 types: Item, Ent, and Weapon

Creating Items:
	
	"New Item" // Name of item
	{
		"Type"		"item" // Type of item
		"Price"		"100" // Price of item
		"Category" 	"General" // Category name
		"Job_Reqs" // Jobs that can buy the item
		{
			"1" "JobName" // If you want to allow everyone, simply put "1" "any" here
			"2"	"JobName" // If you have "1" "any" you can remove this line, you can also add more by just adding the first number
		}
	}

Creating Ents:

	"New Ent" // Name of item
	{
		"Type"		"ent" // Type of item
		"Model"		"models/props_spytech/work_table001.mdl" // Model path of item
		"Price"		"100" // Price of item
		"Category"	"General" // Category name
		"Job_Reqs" // Jobs that can buy the item
		{
			"1" "JobName" // If you want to allow everyone, simply put "1" "any" here
			"2" "JobName" // If you have "1" "any" you can remove this line, you can also add more by just adding the first number
		}
	}

Creating Weapons:
	
	"Shotgun" // Name of weapon (doesn't have to be actual weapon's name)
	{
		"Type"		"weapon" // Type of item
		"Price"		"100" // Price of item
		"id"		"10" // Id of weapon (see http://wiki.alliedmods.net/Team_Fortress_2_Item_Definition_Indexes)
		"Job_Reqs" // Jobs that can buy the item
		{
			"1" "JobName" // If you want to allow everyone, simply put "1" "any" here
			"2" "JobName" // If you have "1" "any" you can remove this line, you can also add more by just adding the first number
		}
		"Category"	"Weapons" // Category of item
	}

[ NPC Types ]
You can change prices of NPC's items

You probably won't need to make another NPC type unless you're making an addon
NPC Types can be found in tfrp_npctypes

	"NewNPC" // NPC Type name
	{
		"Model"	"models/player/heavy.mdl" // NPC's model
		"Buys_Items" // List of items the NPC buys
		{
			"Sandvich"	"250" // Name and price
		}
	}

[ What's New? ]

v1.4.0 - Thank you Illusion Squid for these changes

*SQL fixed to have no Duplicate rows inside the inventory table.
*Inventory fixed for the new SQL system and made so it stays open if you have more of the item.
*Shop fixed for the new SQL system and also made easier to buy/sell multiple of 1 item.
*Wearable weapons like backpacks, boots, shields, etc. are now also removed on spawn.
*The targeting for admin commands is now working the same as any other sourcemod command.
